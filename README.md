# AMQP Support for Stasis in Asterisk

Support asterisk with a latest wazo-platform version or Asterisk 16.5.0.

## How does it works

1. Client Sends request application via ARI
2. Asterisk create application and registers it to Stasis
3. Receiver receives events
4. Client receives response via AMQP

```ascii
 +--- stasis application
 |
 v                     |                                  |
[client]-------------->|  topic --> (*)--> callback---+   |
                       |                    |    ^    |   |
                       |                    |    |    +-->| ==== event ==> [RabbitMQ Exchange(s)]
                       |                    v    |        |
        <--------------|       event >>> Stasis -+        |
```

## How to install

To build the module you will need the following dependencies

* asterisk-dev
* librabbitmq-dev

Clone the amqp client repository:

```sh
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-res-amqp
make
make install
```

Clone stasis amqp modules:

```sh
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-res-stasis-amqp
make
make install
make samples
```

Configure the file in `/etc/asterisk/stasis_amqp.conf`

You need to have `res_amqp.so` loaded.

Please restart asterisk before loading `res_stasis_amqp.so` for the
documentation.

To load module

```sh
CLI> module load res_ari_amqp.so
CLI> module load res_stasis_amqp.so
```

## How to use

### ARI

on your asterisk dialplan. For an application named 'bar'

```dialplan
exten = 6001,1,NoOp()
same  = n,Answer()
same  = n,Stasis(bar) ; this will generate events which will be forwarded to stasis (websocket or AMQP)
same  = n,Hangup()
```

To activate the events on AMQP for your ARI application you need to use the ARI
REST API endpoint.

Create a Stasis Application named 'bar'

```http
POST with applicationName=bar
```

This will create an internal application that will send events to AMQP

To delete the application created above

```http
DELETE with applicationName=bar
```

This will delete the application, events will no longer be sent to AMQP

Event is push on this routing key `stasis.app.<app name>`

### AMI

You don't need to anything for the configuration, all AMI events is pushed by
default on rabbitmq

Event is push on this routing key `stasis.ami.<event name>`

### Channels

You don't need to anything for the configuration, all channels events is pushed
by default on rabbitmq

Event is push on this routing key `stasis.channel.<channel uniqueid>`

## Information

- If you register an application with the websocket, it's possible to disabled
  it by the amqp endpoint ARI.
- If you restart Asterisk you loose the application.
- If you registering an application on the websocket with the same name of an
  application already registered with the AMQP events, the callback is on
  websocket.
